It will be supplied with pristine streets, parks, malls and a church.\r\n\r\nHow do you test new technologies and systems for urban environments without those pesky humans getting in the way?\r\n\r\n####[Ansel Adams Photographs of US National Parks](https://www.archives.gov/research/ansel-adams/)\r\n\r\n> In 1941 the National Park Service commissioned noted photographer Ansel Adams to create a photo mural for the Department of the Interior Building in Washington, DC. The theme was to be nature as exemplified and protected in the U.S. National Parks. The project was halted because of World War II and never resumed.\r\n>\r\n> The holdings of the National Archives Still Picture Branch include 226 photographs taken for this project, most of them signed and captioned by Adams.\r\n\r\nThese black and white photographs echo the stark visual contrast that signifies Adams's most striking works of photography.\r\n\r\n####[Wireless Power](http://ubeam.com/)\r\n\r\n> The uBeam system is composed of two parts: a transmitter that emits energy, and a receiver that receives energy. The transmitter is like a sound speaker, but instead of emitting audible sound, uBeam's transmitter emits high frequency sound. This sound can't be heard by humans or dogs; it's called ultrasound. The receiver, like a microphone, picks up the sound and converts it into usable energy. Sound, like light and wind, is a form of energy that can be converted into electrical energy with our proprietary energy harvesting technology. The receiver then sends this electrical power to charge or power an electronic device. \r\n\r\nUbeam wants us to experience a world without wires. This technology is currently focused on charging and powering mobile devices, tablets, and laptops.\r\n\r\n####[Light Camera](https://light.co/camera)\r\n\r\nA point and shoot sized camera that uses 16 lenses and computational power to generate surprisingly high quality pictures and 4k video.
